# Memory Game Project

This game was built as a [Udacity](www.udacity.com) Front End Nano Degree project. The purpose is to demostrate mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Udacity Project Instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
To start the project I open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the 
[Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play:

To start matching game simple click on a card. When a card is clicked on the timer is started until all matches are made. 
Once a match is made the cards will stay turned over. When all 16 cards are matched (8 total matches), a modal will appear telling you that you won and listing your final stats in time, moves and star rating. 
You will have an option to play again and the board is reset.
